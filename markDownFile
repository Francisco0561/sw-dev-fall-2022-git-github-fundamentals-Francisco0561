I think that I have most of it down, the one things that I am still a little confused on is just the pull request and commits and pushing.
I understand about how to Fork, and what repositories are and pretty much all the other terms. I do still need to wacth a video on everyting
, just to make sure that I understand everything fully

Hopefully I did this right
